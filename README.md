# FizzBuzz Challenge - Javascript
This aim of this project was to replicate the FizzBuzz challenge that we had previously completed for Ruby, but this time in Javascript. This allowed us to gain a better understanding of some of the high level differences in syntax between the two languages as well as the differences between testing. 

Please refer to this link for the original instructions for this challenge: https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/thermostat_es6/fizzbuzz_in_javascript.md

**Fizzbuzz rules**
---

- Print the numbers from 1 to 100
- If a number is divisible by 3 print "Fizz" instead
- If a number is divisible by 5 print "Buzz" instead
- If a number is divisible by 3 and 5 print "FizzBuzz" instead

**Running the challenge**
---

To run the tests open your web browser (Google Chrome advised), and paste the below into the url bar:

```
/Users/dharapatel/Projects/Makers_Main_Course/WK5/FizzBuzz-JS/jasmine-standalone-3.5.0/SpecRunner.html
```

To see the list of numbers from 1 to 100 that apply to the rules outlined above:

1. Right click on the SpecRunner.html page and click on 'Inspect'
2. Navigate to the 'Console' shown on the top bar of the Javascript console, this should show a list of numbers     which where applicable, are replaced with "Fizz", "Buzz" or "FizzBuzz".
